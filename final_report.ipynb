    "The aim of our project is to learn how to implement robot navigation with the help of a camera. The challenge is to relate the robot's data to that provided by the camera in order to get the most accurate motion control. For that, we need to link several modules together: computer vision, filtering, global navigation and local navigation. Initially, we dealt with each of these modules separately before grouping them together in a single code."
